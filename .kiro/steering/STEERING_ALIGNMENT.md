# Steering Documentation Alignment Summary

This document summarizes the alignment of all steering files with the Better Auth migration.

## Files Updated

### 1. `.kiro/steering/better-auth.md` (NEW)
**Status**: ✅ Created

Comprehensive Better Auth migration guide including:
- Core architecture patterns (server and client instances)
- Required API route protection patterns with Arcjet
- User registration and authentication flows
- Database schema with Better Auth tables
- Environment variable configuration
- Security features and error handling
- TypeScript types and testing patterns
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Future enhancement possibilities

### 2. `.kiro/steering/tech.md`
**Status**: ✅ Updated

**Changes Made**:
- Added "Authentication & Security" section to Technology Stack
- Updated API Route Structure to include Better Auth session verification
- Added reference to `better-auth.md` for authentication patterns
- Shows complete flow: Arcjet → Better Auth session → validation → business logic

**Key Pattern**:
```typescript
// 1. Arcjet protection FIRST
const decision = await ajAuthAPI.protect(request);
const errorResponse = handleArcjetDecision(decision);
if (errorResponse) return errorResponse;

// 2. Better Auth session verification
const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: request.headers });
if (!session?.user) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
}

// 3. Business logic with session.user.id
```

### 3. `.kiro/steering/security.md`
**Status**: ✅ Updated

**Changes Made**:
- Updated Authentication section to describe Better Auth features
- Replaced JWT/bcrypt references with Better Auth's scrypt hashing
- Added HTTP-only cookies, CSRF protection, session management details
- Updated Required Pattern for All API Routes to include Better Auth
- Added reference to `better-auth.md` for detailed patterns

**Key Updates**:
- Password hashing: `scrypt` (OWASP recommended)
- Session storage: HTTP-only cookies (prevents XSS)
- Session expiry: 7-day with automatic refresh
- Built-in CSRF protection

### 4. `.kiro/steering/structure.md`
**Status**: ✅ Updated

**Changes Made**:
- Updated Directory Structure to include Better Auth files:
  - `lib/auth.ts` - Better Auth server instance
  - `lib/auth-client.ts` - Better Auth client instance
  - `lib/services/auth.ts` - Authentication service
- Updated API Route Structure example with Better Auth session verification
- Updated Required Environment Variables to include Better Auth variables
- Added reference to `better-auth.md` for authentication patterns

**New Environment Variables**:
```bash
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
BETTER_AUTH_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL=
ARCJET_KEY=
```

**Removed Variables** (from old system):
- `JWT_SECRET` (replaced by `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (replaced by `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` (replaced by `BETTER_AUTH_URL`)

### 5. `.kiro/steering/product.md`
**Status**: ✅ No changes needed

This file focuses on product features and user experience, which remain unchanged by the authentication migration. The security and GDPR compliance requirements are still valid.

## Consistency Verification

### ✅ API Route Pattern Consistency
All steering files now show the same API route pattern:
1. Arcjet protection (first)
2. Better Auth session verification (second)
3. Input validation
4. Business logic
5. Error handling
6. Response

### ✅ Import Statement Consistency
All examples use consistent imports:
```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";
import { ajAuthAPI, handleArcjetDecision } from "@/lib/arcjet";
```

### ✅ Session Verification Consistency
All examples use the same session verification pattern:
```typescript
const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: request.headers });
if (!session?.user) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
}
```

### ✅ Environment Variable Consistency
All files reference the same Better Auth environment variables:
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL`

### ✅ Cross-Reference Consistency
All files that mention authentication now reference `better-auth.md` for detailed patterns.

## Migration Impact on Steering Docs

### What Changed
- Authentication method: Custom JWT → Better Auth
- Password hashing: bcrypt → scrypt
- Session storage: JWT tokens → HTTP-only cookies
- Session verification: Custom JWT verification → `auth.api.getSession()`
- Environment variables: JWT_SECRET → BETTER_AUTH_SECRET

### What Stayed the Same
- Arcjet security protection (still first in API routes)
- GDPR compliance requirements
- Audit logging patterns
- Encryption for audio files
- Product features and UX
- Performance requirements
- Database structure (with additions)

## Implementation Guidance

When implementing Better Auth migration tasks, AI assistants should:

1. **Always read `better-auth.md` first** for authentication-related tasks
2. **Follow the API route pattern** exactly as shown in all steering files
3. **Never skip Arcjet protection** - it must come before session verification
4. **Use `session.user.id`** for user identification in business logic
5. **Preserve custom fields** (encryptionKeyHash, gdprConsent) when creating users
6. **Maintain audit logging** for all authentication events
7. **Test thoroughly** - registration, login, session management, protected routes

## Verification Checklist

Before considering the migration complete, verify:

- [ ] All API routes use Better Auth session verification
- [ ] No references to JWT or bcrypt remain in code
- [ ] All environment variables are updated
- [ ] Custom fields (encryptionKeyHash, gdprConsent) are preserved
- [ ] Audit logging still works for authentication events
- [ ] GDPR compliance features still work
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated

## Future Enhancements

With Better Auth in place, these features become easier to add:
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA plugin)
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, Apple)
- Magic links (passwordless authentication)
- Passkeys (WebAuthn support)
- Multi-session management

See `better-auth.md` for details on implementing these features.
