# Requirements Document

## Introduction

VoiceFlow AI is a production-ready voice note-taking application that combines real-time audio recording, AI-powered transcription, and intelligent content processing. The system enables users to capture voice notes, automatically transcribe them using advanced speech-to-text technology, and leverage AI to generate summaries, extract insights, and organize content. Built with Next.js 15, OpenAI GPT-4, and Deepgram, the application prioritizes security, performance, and GDPR compliance while maintaining 94-97% gross margins through optimized AI service usage.

2. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL achieve ≥90% accuracy on clear speech recordings
3. WHEN processing real-time audio THEN the system SHALL stream transcription results with <500ms latency
4. IF transcription fails THEN the system SHALL retry with fallback provider (AssemblyAI) AND notify the user of the retry attempt
5. WHEN transcription includes multiple speakers THEN the system SHALL provide speaker diarization labels when available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-powered summaries and insights from my voice notes, so that I can quickly understand key points without listening to entire recordings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL generate an intelligent summary using GPT-4o
2. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL extract and display key topics, action items, and important dates
3. WHEN generating AI responses THEN the system SHALL maintain <2% hallucination rate through validated prompt engineering
4. IF AI processing fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to transcription-only mode AND notify the user
5. WHEN content is flagged as inappropriate THEN the system SHALL mark it with a warning using safety filters with 98% precision

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize my voice notes in folders and tag them, so that I can efficiently manage and retrieve my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating notes THEN the system SHALL allow users to assign notes to custom folders and tags
2. WHEN searching content THEN the system SHALL return full-text search results across transcriptions with <100ms response time
3. WHEN organizing notes THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical folder structures AND multiple tags per note
4. IF folder operations fail THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity AND display a clear error message
5. WHEN viewing notes THEN the system SHALL display metadata including creation date, duration, and processing status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my voice data protected with enterprise-grade security, so that my private conversations remain confidential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is uploaded THEN the system SHALL encrypt the data using AES-256-GCM before storage
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.3 for all communications
3. WHEN storing files THEN the system SHALL implement end-to-end encryption with user-controlled keys
4. IF a security breach occurs THEN the system SHALL notify affected users within 72 hours per GDPR requirements
5. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL permanently remove all associated files AND database records within the specified timeframe

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want GDPR-compliant data handling, so that my privacy rights are protected according to European regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL obtain explicit consent for voice data processing
2. WHEN a user requests data export THEN the system SHALL provide complete data export in structured JSON/ZIP format within 30 days
3. WHEN users exercise deletion rights THEN the system SHALL remove all personal data including backups within 30 days
4. IF data is transferred internationally THEN the system SHALL use Standard Contractual Clauses for data protection
5. WHEN processing voice data THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed audit logs for compliance purposes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast, reliable performance, so that I can use the application without delays or interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the application THEN the system SHALL achieve Time to First Byte <200ms
2. WHEN processing API requests THEN the system SHALL maintain P95 response times <500ms
3. WHEN transcribing audio THEN the system SHALL process files at 5-10x real-time speed through parallel processing
4. IF system load increases THEN the system SHALL auto-scale database connections AND maintain performance targets
5. WHEN serving global users THEN the system SHALL use CDN with 99% cache hit rate for static asset delivery

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably across different devices and browsers, so that I can access my notes anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing from mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design with touch-optimized controls
2. WHEN using different browsers THEN the system SHALL support Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge with consistent functionality
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide offline capabilities AND sync data when reconnected
4. IF required browser features are missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality AND display clear messaging to the user
5. WHEN switching devices THEN the system SHALL maintain session state AND sync data across platforms

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics, so that I can ensure optimal performance and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging without exposing sensitive user data
2. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track key metrics including response times, error rates, and user engagement
3. WHEN detecting anomalies THEN the system SHALL alert administrators within 5 minutes of threshold breach
