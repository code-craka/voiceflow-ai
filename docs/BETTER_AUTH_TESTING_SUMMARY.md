**Requirements Covered**: 11.5

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Files**: 5
- **Total Test Cases**: 64
- **Requirements Covered**: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
- **Test Type**: Integration tests (real database)

## Test Features

### Comprehensive Coverage

1. **Authentication Flow**: Complete registration and login flows
2. **Session Management**: Creation, expiration, refresh, and deletion
3. **Authorization**: Protected route access and user data isolation
4. **Data Preservation**: Custom fields and all relationships
5. **Error Handling**: Invalid inputs, expired sessions, malformed tokens

### Best Practices

1. **Cleanup**: All tests include proper cleanup in `afterEach`/`afterAll` hooks
2. **Isolation**: Tests use unique email addresses with timestamps
3. **Real Database**: Tests use actual database connections (not mocked)
4. **Verification**: Tests verify both application logic and database state
5. **Documentation**: Each test file includes clear descriptions and requirements

### Test Data Management

- Tests create their own test data
- Tests clean up all created data after execution
- Tests don't interfere with each other
- Tests use unique identifiers to avoid conflicts
