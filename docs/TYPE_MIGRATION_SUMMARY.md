# TypeScript Types Migration Summary

## Task 12: Update TypeScript Types

### Completed: ✅

This document summarizes the changes made to TypeScript types as part of the Better Auth migration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Old JWT-Related Types (Task 12.1)

**Removed from `types/auth.ts`:**
- `AuthSession` interface - Replaced by Better Auth's Session type
- `AuthToken` interface - No longer needed with Better Auth's session management

### 2. Added Better Auth Types (Task 12.2)

**Added to `types/auth.ts`:**
- Import and re-export `Session` type from Better Auth
- `RegistrationResponse` interface - Response from registration service
- `AuthSuccessResponse` interface - Generic auth success response
- `AuthErrorResponse` interface - Generic auth error response

### 3. Updated Existing Types

**Updated `User` interface:**
- Added `name: string` (required by Better Auth)
- Added `emailVerified: boolean` (required by Better Auth)
- Added `image?: string` (optional profile image)
- Kept all custom fields: `encryptionKeyHash`, `gdprConsent`

**Preserved types:**
- `GDPRConsent` - Custom GDPR consent structure
- `UserRegistrationRequest` - Registration payload
- `UserLoginRequest` - Login payload
- `UserWithEncryptionKey` - User with encryption key (returned after registration)

## Type Structure

### Better Auth Session Type

```typescript
import type { Session } from "@/lib/auth";

// Session structure from Better Auth
interface Session {
  user: {
    id: string;
    email: string;
    name: string;
    emailVerified: boolean;
    image?: string;
  };
  session: {
    id: string;
    expiresAt: Date;
    token: string;
    userId: string;
  };
}
```

### Custom VoiceFlow AI Types

```typescript
// GDPR Consent (preserved)
interface GDPRConsent {
  dataProcessing: boolean;
  voiceRecording: boolean;
  aiProcessing: boolean;
  consentedAt: Date;
  ipAddress?: string;
}

// User with custom fields
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  emailVerified: boolean;
  image?: string;
  encryptionKeyHash: string;  // Custom field
  gdprConsent: GDPRConsent;   // Custom field
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

// Registration response
interface RegistrationResponse {
  user: Session["user"];
  session: Session["session"];
  encryptionKey: string;
}
```

## Files Updated

1. **`types/auth.ts`** - Main auth types file
   - Removed old JWT types
   - Added Better Auth types
   - Updated User interface
   - Added new response types

2. **`lib/services/auth.ts`** - Auth service
   - Updated return type to include new User fields (name, emailVerified, image)
   - Maintained compatibility with existing code

## Verification

✅ All TypeScript files compile without errors
✅ No remaining references to `AuthToken` or `AuthSession` in code
✅ All imports of auth types work correctly
✅ Custom fields (encryptionKeyHash, gdprConsent) preserved
✅ GDPR consent types maintained
✅ Registration and authentication flows type-safe

## Impact Analysis

### Breaking Changes
- `AuthSession` interface removed - use Better Auth's `Session` type instead
- `AuthToken` interface removed - Better Auth handles tokens internally

### Non-Breaking Changes
- `User` interface extended with Better Auth fields
- New response types added for better type safety
- All existing custom types preserved

## Next Steps

The type migration is complete. The following tasks remain in the Better Auth migration:

- [ ] Task 13: Testing and verification
- [ ] Task 14: Clean up old code
- [ ] Task 15: Update README and setup instructions

## Notes

- No code in the codebase was importing the removed `AuthToken` or `AuthSession` types
- The migration maintains full backward compatibility with custom fields
- All GDPR-related types remain unchanged
- Type safety is improved with Better Auth's generated types
